# Forest Fire Prediction App

This project is a **machine learning-powered web application** built with **Streamlit** that predicts the likelihood of a forest fire based on weather indices and time-based features via CSV upload.

##  Features

-  **Predict forest fire** probability using Random Forest model  
-  **Feature importance** visualization   
-  Year-wise **fire trend analysis**  
-  **Map** with marker to show static prediction location  
-  Upload **CSV file** for batch predictions
